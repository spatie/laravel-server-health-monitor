We all dream of servers that need no maintenance at all. But unfortunately in reality this is not the case. Disks can get full, processes can crash, the server can run out of memory...

This package keeps an eye on the health of all your servers. There are a few [checks that come out of the box](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-server-monitor/v1/monitoring-basics/built-in-checks). [Adding new checks](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-server-monitor/v1/monitoring-basics/writing-your-own-checks) is a breeze.

When something goes wrong it can [notify you](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-server-monitor/v1/monitoring-basics/notifications-and-events) via Slack or mail. Here's how a Slack notification look like:

<img src="https://docs.spatie.be/images/server-monitor/check-failed.jpg" class="screenshot -slack">

Behind the scenes [Laravel's native notification system](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/notifications) is leveraged so you can use one of the [many notification drivers](http://laravel-notification-channels.com/).

## Documentation

The full documentation is available on [our documentation site](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-server-monitor).

## Installation

You can install this package via composer using this command:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-server-monitor
```

In Laravel 5.5 the service provider will automatically get registered. In older versions of the framework, you must install the service provider:

```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\ServerMonitor\ServerMonitorServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish the migrations with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\ServerMonitor\ServerMonitorServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

After the migration has been published you can create the `hosts`  and `checks `tables by running the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You must publish the config-file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\ServerMonitor\ServerMonitorServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    /*
     * These are the checks that can be performed on your servers. You can add your own
     * checks. The only requirement is that they should extend the
